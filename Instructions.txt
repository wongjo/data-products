A binomial random variable results from the outcome of a success or failure of a trial, such as flipping a coin. 

This random simulator will generate a binomially distributed outcome with the following selectable parameters:
1 to 5001 trials,
1 to 5001 observations per trial, 
with a probability of 0 to 1 for each observation (a coin is a probabilty of 0.5).

a random number seed may be chosen from 1 to 10, for replicatable results from the system random generator.

The Summary Tab displays Minimum, Maximum, and Quartiles of the successful observations of the trials.
The Structure Tab displays the data structure of the trials.
The Data Tab displays the data of the successful observations of the trials.
The Plot Tab displays a histogram of the data of the successful observations of the trials.

Selectable Plot options are:
Maximum number of histogram bins (1 to 200)
Bar color (White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, or Black)
Display normal curve overlay (Yes or No)
Line color of the normal curve (White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, or Black)

The ui.R Tab displays the ui.R source file.
The server.R Tab displays the server.R source file.
